BH1RLW is my amateur radio callsign.

I think it probably means :

  * Repair Linux Wireless
  * Rapid Lose Weight

I am a new radio amateur in Beijing, China. My name is 王康 ( Wang Kang ).

I just received my license from CHINESE RADIO SPORTS ASSOCIATION ( CRSA ).
    
    Callsign : BH1RLW
    QTH: Beijing, China.

My rigs are Yaesu FT-817 and UV-5R.

I am also interested in Software Defined Radio (SDR), and having fun with GNURadio project.
